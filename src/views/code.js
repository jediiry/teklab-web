Private program customers are private, and no submitted vulnerability (including duplicates, Out of Scope, Not Applicable, etc.) may be disclosed without explicit customer permission. Please read each Bounty Brief for specific program disclosure policies which supersede (overrule) this policy. We expect everyone to use the proper channels to disclose or communicate about vulnerability submissions. Email Teklabspace Support if you have any questions about disclosure. 
      If a vulnerability provides unintended access to data: Limit the amount of data you access to the minimum required for effectively demonstrating the vulnerability; and cease testing and submit a report immediately if you encounter any user data during testing, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Personal Healthcare Information (PHI), credit card data, or proprietary information. In the event you access PII or other sensitive data, please note that you are required to follow all laws and regulations applicable to the access and processing of such personally identifiable information and/or data, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679), including the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses regarding the transfer of personal data to processors. 
      Read and abide by Teklabspace’s Standard Disclosure Terms and each program’s Bounty Brief. We expect you to follow any guidelines and rules that a particular crowdsourced security program or company may have regarding scope of testing and disclosure. For more information on disclosure policies at Teklabspace, visit the Researcher Documentation Centre, our Researcher Resources, or FAQ. 
      Report bad behavior. As a member of this community you have the ability to impact the quality and reputation of the Crowd. If you see something that violates our guidelines, please notify our operations team immediately at Teklabspace Support. `,

      Neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party and any attempt to do so will be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Teklabspace may assign this Agreement to an entity in connection with a reorganization, merger, consolidation, acquisition, or other restructuring involving all or part of the voting securities or assets of Teklabspace upon written notice to Service Provider. Any notice or consent under this Agreement will be in writing to the address or email address specified below within the signature block in the accompanying SOW. Terms and conditions of this agreement are subject to change without prior notice and are effective upon any such update. For the duration of this agreement and for thirty-six (36) months after, Service Provider will not hire any persons employed by Teklabspace, whether or not such resource had direct interaction with Service Provider under this Agreement. Service Provider agrees that for the term of this Agreement, and any other related definitive agreements that may be entered into by and between the parties (e.g., statements of work), and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, Service Provider shall not, directly or indirectly, bid for, offer, sell or otherwise provide any services or products that directly compete with Teklabspace’s then-existing services or products, to any customer for which Teklabspace and Service Provider have offered to deliver or have jointly delivered services. This restriction includes, but is not limited to any employee, subcontractor, or agent of Teklabspace. No provision of this Agreement will be waived by any act, omission or knowledge of a party or its agents or employees except by an instrument in writing expressly waiving such provision and signed by a duly authorized officer of the waiving party. Service Provider will abide by all policies and guidelines of Teklabspace and customers of Teklabspace. Service Provider hereby acknowledges that from time to time, Teklabspace is required to ensure that all subcontractors engaged by Teklabspace, including Service Provider, are bound by the same or substantially similar terms as Teklabspace under the terms and conditions to which Teklabspace has agreed with Teklabspace’s customers (referred to herein as the “Prime Agreement Terms”), and therefore Services Provider hereby understands and agrees to be bound by any such Prime Agreement Terms. It is Service Provider’s responsibility to request a copy of any such applicable Prime Agreement Terms, and absent any such request Teklabspace is under the assumption that Service Provider is aware of and agrees to be bound by such Prime Agreement Terms. If any provision of this Agreement is adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect. This Agreement is governed by and to be construed in accordance with Nigeria law. Each party hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Nigeria courts as regards any claim, dispute or matter arising out of or in connection with this Agreement and its implementation and effect. Any waivers or amendments shall be effective only if made in writing signed by a representative of the respective parties. Both parties agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties, and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements and communications relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. In the event that Teklabspace loans Service Provider any equipment during the course of its engagement, Service Provider shall be responsible for returning it in the same condition in which Service Provider received it. Such equipment will be loaned as is with all faults. Teklabspace reserves the right to charge Service Provider for any damage it finds, beyond the normal wear and tear.
